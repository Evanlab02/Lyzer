# Development (Getting Started)

Welcome to the Lyzer development getting started guide! This guide will help you set up everything you need to start contributing to the project.

## Prerequisites  

Before diving into development, ensure you have the following tools installed:  

- **Docker**: For containerizing and managing the development environment.  
- **Docker Compose**: To orchestrate the various containers required for Lyzer.  
- **An IDE or Editor**: We recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for backend development and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for frontend development, but feel free to use your preferred editor.

## Troubleshooting  

### Common Issues  

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure no other services are running on the same ports used by Lyzer.  

### Getting Help  

If you encounter issues that you canâ€™t resolve, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository or reach out to the project maintainers.
