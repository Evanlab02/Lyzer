## Summary

We are currently using React 18.3.1 in the Lyzer project frontend. I propose upgrading to React 19. While React 18.3.1 is not yet causing any issues, planning ahead for this migration will ensure smoother adoption of new features and prevent potential compatibility issues in the future.

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: Low
- **Scope**: Component
- **Risk Profile**: Low
- **Development Impact**: No immediate impact, except for actual upgrading work and potential component adjustments
- **Area**: Frontend

## Detailed Description

React 19 is expected to introduce several improvements and new features that could benefit our application. Our current React 18.3.1 implementation works well, but as React 19 becomes the standard, we may encounter:

- Increasing compatibility issues with newer libraries that target React 19
- Missing out on performance improvements and new features
- Potential security updates that are only available in newer versions
- Growing complexity in eventual migration if deferred too long

The migration task involves updating the React core packages, testing for compatibility issues with our existing components, and potentially refactoring code to adapt to any breaking changes.

## Proposed Resolution

To successfully migrate to React 19, we would need to:

1. Review the official migration guide and changelog
2. Update our package.json dependencies
   - Update `react` from ^18.3.1 to ^19.0.0
   - Update `react-dom` from ^18.3.1 to ^19.0.0
   - Update `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to compatible versions
3. Run and fix any dependency conflicts
4. Test all components for compatibility issues
5. Address any deprecated API usages
6. Update our CI/CD pipeline to ensure compatibility
7. Update documentation to reflect React 19 usage

## Benefits of Resolution

The benefits of upgrading to React 19 would include:

- Access to new React features and improvements
- Better compatibility with the latest React ecosystem
- Improved performance of our frontend application
- Reduced technical debt through incremental updates rather than major leaps
- Preventing security vulnerabilities that might only be fixed in newer versions

Some potential downsides include:

- Initial development effort required for the upgrade
- Potential breaking changes requiring component refactoring
- Possibility of being early adopters if upgraded too soon

## Risks of Deferral

- Growing migration complexity as we fall further behind the latest version
- Increasing incompatibility with newer libraries and tools
- Missing out on performance and security improvements
- Higher developer time cost when eventually forced to upgrade
- More challenging debugging if using outdated React patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- All frontend components function as expected with React 19
- All tests pass with the upgraded React version
- Build and deployment processes work correctly
- No regression in application performance
- Documentation is updated to reflect React 19 usage
- No critical console warnings related to deprecated API usage
