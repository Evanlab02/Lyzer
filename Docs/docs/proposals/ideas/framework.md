# Idea Proposal Framework

This document outlines the standard process for proposing, documenting, and implementing new ideas within the Lyzer project.

## 1. Proposal Template

When proposing a new feature, architectural change, or significant enhancement, please use the following template:

```markdown
# [Idea Title]

- Author: [Your GitHub Username]
- Email: [Your Email, if you feel comfortable sharing it]
- Date: [Date of proposal]
- Status: [Draft/Review/Approved/Rejected/In Progress/Done]
- Planned: [Yes/No]
- Milestone: [Milestone name if planned]

## Summary
A concise summary (2-3 sentences) of the proposed idea.

## Motivation
Why is this idea valuable? What problems does it solve? Who benefits?

## Detailed Description

A thorough explanation of the idea, including:

- Technical details
- Diagrams where applicable
- Basic mockups where applicable
- Implementation approach
- Any alternatives considered (where applicable)

## Requirements

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Dependencies on other systems/features

## Implementation Plan
- Step by step implementation plan
    - This can change as we learn more about the idea, just a starting point

## Risks and Concerns
Any potential issues or challenges that should be considered.

## Open Questions
List any aspects that need further clarification.
```

## 2. Review Process

All idea proposals should follow these review steps:

1. **Draft Creation**: Author creates the proposal document following the template above
2. **Peer Review**: Share with maintainers for initial feedback
3. **Refinement**: Update based on initial feedback
4. **Approval**: Receive formal approval from the maintainers
5. **Documentation**: Finalize and integrate into project documentation
6. **Wait for next milestone planning**: The idea will be considered for the next milestone

## 3. Documentation Standards

### Directory Structure

Place the idea documentation in the appropriate directory:

- `/Docs/docs/proposals/ideas/` - For idea proposals

### Formatting Guidelines

- Use Markdown consistently
- Include a clear title (H1) at the top of each document
- Organize content with hierarchical headings (H2, H3, etc.)
- Use bulleted lists for items without specific sequence
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Add diagrams when they clarify complex concepts (using Excalidraw or similar)

### Images and Diagrams

- Store images in the appropriate `/Docs/docs/proposals/ideas/assets/` subdirectory
- Use descriptive filenames for images

### Links and References

- Use relative links for internal documentation references
- Include descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
- Verify all links work before committing
- Include references to external resources when applicable

## 4. Integration with Development Process

Documentation should be integrated with our development process:

1. **Proposal First**: Document ideas before implementation begins
2. **Update During Development**: Revise documentation as implementation progresses
3. **Review Documentation**: Include documentation review in PR process

## Example Proposal

See [Example Feature Proposal](../examples/example-idea-proposal.md) for a complete example following this framework.
