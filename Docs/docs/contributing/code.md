### Board

We have a [board/project](https://github.com/users/LittleClumsy/projects/2) for managing issues in GitHub. If you are a maintainer, you should have edit/write access to the board, if you don't, please reach out to the team.

Before picking up an issue, please ensure you have communicated to the team that you will be working on an issue and have assigned yourself to the issue.

For code contributions, you should only be taking issues from the "Todo" column.

Once you start working on an issue, please move the issue to the "In Progress" column.

When you are ready to submit your PR and have it reviewed, please move the issue to the "Ready for Review" column.

A maintainer will review your PR and either approve it or give you feedback.

### PRs

When opening a PR, please ensure that your issue is linked to the PR.
