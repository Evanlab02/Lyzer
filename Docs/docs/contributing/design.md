# Design Contributions

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lyzer's design! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to the design of the application.

This can fall into two categories:

- UI/UX Design
- Architectural Design

We will cover both of these in this guide.

## UI/UX Design

First and foremost, thank you for your contribution. At the stage of writing this, we are only 2 developers with limited UX experience, so we are always looking for ways to improve the application.

### Making a design propsal

We do not expect designers to have to dive into git and create a PR, so please follow the following template to create a design proposal in the GitHub issues.

```

## Can we contact you?

In this section just let us know if we can contact you for further discussions and if you would like to be credited for your work. We believe that design is an always ongoing effort and we would love to be able to talk to you about it.
