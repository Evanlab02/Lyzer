# Documentation Contributions

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lyzer's documentation! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to the documentation.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Refer to the [development getting started guide](../dev/index.md) for instructions on how to set up your development environment.

You should also look at the [code contribution guidelines](./code.md) for instructions on how to contribute code to Lyzer, as the process is similar.

## Contributing

For documentation contributions, you do not require an issue to start contributing.

We welcome all documentation contributions, when you open your PR ensure that you are detailing why the changes were made, what the benefits are, and any other relevant information.

When writing documentation, consider the following:

- Use Markdown consistently
- Include a clear title (H1) at the top of each document
- Organize content with hierarchical headings (H2, H3, etc.)
- Use bulleted lists for items without specific sequence
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Add diagrams when they clarify complex concepts (using Excalidraw or similar)
- Ensure you put assets into the `assets` directory within the folder you are working in.
    - Assets are things like images, diagrams, etc.

## Review Process

When you open your PR, it will be reviewed by a maintainer.

The maintainer will review your PR and either approve it or give you feedback.

If you need to make changes, you can do so by committing to your branch and pushing to your PR.

Once you have made the changes, you can request a review from the maintainer.
